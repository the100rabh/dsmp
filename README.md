# Damn Small Media Player (DSMP)

I know there are loads of mp3 players available, so why one more. The motivation behind me writing this app is that I am fed up with the ever increasing size of mp3 players. This is meant to ease my pain :-P. I aim to keep its size below 2MB at all costs. May at the cost of feature, buts its fine

This is current in Beta stage. Please file your bugs at here on github

Currently only supports windows XP, Vista and Win7

## About the Code

The app is written using wxWidgets library in C++. I used the wxDev-Cpp IDE for development.

Though I have written it in windows, it can be compiled in other platforms like Mac or Linux also without any code change :-). This is thanks to wxWidgets Library which is cross-platform. You need to write a different make file for those platforms. In case you do, please let me know so that I can make it available for download for others too.

To reduce size further I have used UPX which is pretty cool and is also available for Linux too.

You can contact me at dsmp.saurabh a! GM@ail.com for further info.

Note : In addition to GPL, if you are hosting the exe from your site, you cannot charge for downloads in any manner.
